# 🧠 Persona-Powered Debate Agent

A web-based debate simulation tool that uses LLM agents to generate persuasive, persona-driven arguments across structured debate rounds.

🌐 **Live App**: [https://debate-agents.streamlit.app](https://debate-agents.streamlit.app)

---

## 📌 Overview

This project allows users to simulate formal debates between two personas—either **AI vs AI** or **User vs AI**—on a selected topic. Built using **Streamlit** and powered by **LLMs (Large Language Models)**, it provides structured argumentation phases: **Constructive**, **Rebuttal**, and **Closing Statements**.

Speech bubbles simulate live dialogue and emphasize clarity, contrast, and professionalism in visual design. At the end, an **AI Judge** evaluates both sides and provides a verdict.

## 🎯 Features

- ✍️ **User vs AI** or 🤖 **AI vs AI** modes  
- 💬 Realistic debate structure with 3 rounds and 6 total turns  
- 🧠 Customizable personas for flexible roleplay  
- 💡 Rebuttals include *new arguments*, not just reworded points  
- 👨‍⚖️ Final summary and **AI-generated verdict**

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 🔁 Debate Flow

| Phase        | Persona 1       | Persona 2       |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Constructive | Argues for      | Argues against  |
| Rebuttal     | Rebuts and adds | Rebuts and adds |
| Closing      | Summarizes case | Summarizes case |

Each turn is generated by an LLM using context-aware prompting based on:
- The debate **topic**
- The speaking **persona**
- The **current debate phase**
- The **opponent's prior turn** and **full transcript**

---

### ⚙️ LLM Agents

The app uses [`meta-llama/Llama-3-8b-chat-hf`](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama) via the [Together AI API](https://www.together.ai/).

Each agent behaves like an autonomous debater, guided by:
- Role-specific instruction ("You are a free-market tech entrepreneur…")
- Debate phase cues ("Constructive", "Rebuttal", etc.)
- The conversation history

#### 🧑‍⚖️ Judging Agent

At the end of the debate, a **judge agent** reviews the full transcript and generates:
- A winner based on argument quality
- Constructive feedback for both sides

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/persona-debate-agent.git
cd persona-debate-agent
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root folder:

```
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

> ⚠️ `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`, but be sure **not to commit it accidentally.**

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Launch the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Free-tier LLM**: This app uses a free, public model from Together AI:
  - Generation may be slower
  - Rate limits may apply
  - Argument depth may be lighter than models like GPT-4
- **No memory across sessions** (only current round context)
- **Text-only** interface (no audio or rich media—yet)
